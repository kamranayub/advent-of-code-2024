# Advent of Code 2024

Using [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/) to learn it.

## Structure

- Folders numbered by day (e.g. Day 1 is `01/`)
- `{day}/main.ts` -- Main run file
- `{day}/main.test.ts` -- Main test file
- `{day}/input.ts` -- Input helpers/module

## Approach

- Disable GitHub Copilot
- Refrain from using ChatGPT and reference Deno docs directly
    - I will note if I ever use ChatGPT, but it will be in a rubber duck format
    - I will **not** use ChatGPT to feed it and try to solve a puzzle
- Write tests first that satisfy the puzzle criteria
- Not overly concerned with efficiency/performance -- this is primarily for learning Deno

## Learnings

Notes and aha moments collected in `README.md` files for each puzzle I work through.
