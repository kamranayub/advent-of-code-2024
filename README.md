# Advent of Code 2024

My learning repo for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). My goal is to use [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/) to learn it.

## Run it

**Prerequisites**

- [Deno 2.1](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/)

Run all the tests:

```sh
deno test
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **Spoilers Ahoy!** The `answer.test.ts` files contain puzzle answers!

## Structure

- Folders numbered by day (e.g. Day 1 is `01/`)
- `{day}/main.ts` -- Main run file
- `{day}/main.test.ts` -- Main test file
- `{day}/input.ts` -- Input helpers/module

## Approach

- Disable GitHub Copilot
- Refrain from using ChatGPT and reference Deno docs directly
    - I will note if I ever use ChatGPT, but it will be in a rubber duck format
    - I will **not** use ChatGPT to feed it and try to solve a puzzle
- Write tests first that satisfy the puzzle criteria
- Not overly concerned with efficiency/performance -- this is primarily for learning Deno

## Learnings

Notes and aha moments collected in `README.md` files for each puzzle I work through.
