# Puzzle 01

## Deno Learnings

- Initialize project with `deno init`
- `import.meta.main` is the program entrypoint
- VS Code: [Install Deno extension](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/#visual-studio-code) to get Intellisense set up
- Testing: 
    - Supports `main_test.ts` or `main.test.ts` filename styles
    - Can use `@std/expect` for Jest-style `expect` assertions
    - Run with `deno test`
- Formatting and linting:
    - Run manually `deno fmt` and `deno lint`
    - Enabled in VS Code settings (`deno.lint` and formatter is `denoland.vscode-deno`)
- Importing
    - Standard library is `@std/` 
    - Prefix with `jsr:` in import module to direct import from JSR
    - **Why doesn't importing without `jsr:` prefix work?**
        - It does if you add via `deno add jsr:@std/*`
        - This wasn't clear when I started with [Testing](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/testing/) page
        - The `jsr:` prefix allows you to import directly without adding
        - _NOTE:_ Using `jsr:` direct imports does not appear to add to `deno.lock` so it does not seem suited for a "project" but nice for scripts (I would advise pinning version but probably only to major thanks to Standard Library long-term compat).
    - Can import outside the project
    - Needs `.ts` module for relative modules
    - Can I use without `.ts`?
        - Yes, but it requires enabling [sloppy imports](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/unstable_flags/#--unstable-sloppy-imports)
        - Why? Sounds like it's for performance reasons.
        - `deno compile` doesn't support sloppy imports
        - Potentially (big) migration task if moving from Node to Deno
            - It would be, except you can run `deno lint --fix` which will [add all the missing file extensions](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/tutorials/cjs_to_esm/#commonjs-vs-ecmascript-resolution) for you :rocket:
- Collections
    - Initially thought about writing manual `Array.sort` function but decided to check stdlib
    - Found `@std/collections` which provides Lodash-like utilities.
    - Used `sortBy` which sorts ASC by default
    - Used `@std/collections/sumOf` to help with calculating times number appears
- Workspaces
    - Easy to [configure monorepo/workspace](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/workspaces/)
    - Add `deno.json` to top-level with folders + shared deps
    - Remove shared deps from individual folder `deno.json` files
    - Add `name` and `exports` fields to individual `deno.json`
    - Export shared stuff for other packages
